# lockscreen
Lockscreen is a windows software to replace the default lockscreen. It provides better security, 2FA, lockscreen widgets and more!

The first versions available won't have any setup procedure, so you will not be able to use the software. They will be usable as soon as I release the Lockscreen Manager software.
Do NOT run the software until then without any knowledge about how to setup the software manually before the Manager software release. You will be locked inside the login screen and cannot leave it without a forced computer shutdown, so all unsaved data will be lost.

Finished features:
- Security: You cant leave the lockscreen or open any program over it.

Working on:
- Password encryption
- Basic login features

Planned:
- Multi Monitor lockscreen wallpaper
- Animated lockscreen wallpaper
- Widgets
- Two Factor Authentification
